# Librairies

1- Numpy

2- Pandas

3- Sklearn

4- Matplotlib

# Algorithms
kNN Algorithm

Decision tree

# Modules
1- Data Extraction: Extraction of data in csv format.

2- Data Cleaning: Taking care of missing values, removal of unwanted attributes. Here for assigning numerical values to string values mymap is used. fillna(mean) and dropna is also used to prepare the data for training using ML model.

3- Machine Learning: Using Machine Learning models kNN and decision tree for Predictive Analysis.
